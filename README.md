## About This Project

This data analysis project examines fatal traffic collisions in Philadelphia from 2019-now, revealing critical patterns in road safety risks. Using Python's data science stack (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), we uncover:

**Key Insights Discovered:**
- 🚗 **Vehicle Patterns**: Passenger cars cause 75% of crashes, but motorcycles are 14x more deadly per mile
- 🚦 **Temporal Trends**: Weekends see 35% more fatalities than weekdays
- 🚸 **Demographic Risks**: Young men (26-35) die at 3x the rate of women
- 🏙️ **Geographic Hotspots**: Just 3 police districts account for 40% of crashes

**Project Features:**
- Automated visualization pipeline for crash patterns
- Demographic risk profiling by age/gender
- Temporal analysis of collision trends

Built with: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebooks
